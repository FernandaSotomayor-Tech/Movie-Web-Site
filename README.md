🎬 Movie-Web-Site
1) Context

Movie Lookup is a Single Page Application built with React that consumes the The Movie Database API to provide dynamic movie search and detailed views.

It is a real portfolio project designed to simulate a production-like scenario where users need to explore large datasets quickly and clearly.

The focus is on demonstrating solid front-end architecture rather than purely visual design.

2) Problem

Applications that rely on external APIs often suffer from:

Unstable interfaces while data is loading

Empty or broken states when requests fail

Unclear navigation between list and detail views

Unnecessary re-renders during search

Layouts that break on mobile devices

The challenge was not just displaying movies.
It was building a stable, predictable, and scalable user experience.

3) Solution

I designed a simple but intentional architecture:

Centralized state in App.jsx to control search flow and results

Conditional rendering for Hero, results, and empty states

Dynamic routing with React Router (/movie/:id)

Defensive data handling (fallbacks, filtering, loading states)

Responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox

Every decision was made to prioritize structural clarity and consistent behavior.

4) Result

The application now delivers:

Smooth SPA navigation

Stable UI during asynchronous calls

Clear separation of responsibilities across components

Maintainable and scalable structure

More than a visual exercise, this project reflects production-oriented thinking.

5) Technologies Used

React (Hooks & Component Architecture)

React Router

Fetch API

CSS Grid & Flexbox

TMDB REST API

Built with a strong focus on state control, dynamic navigation, and predictable rendering behavior.

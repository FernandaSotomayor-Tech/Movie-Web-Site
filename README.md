A high-performance React application focused on seamless data fetching and dynamic user experiences.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Core: React.js (Functional Components & Hooks)

Routing: React Router DOM (Dynamic ID-based navigation)

Data: TMDB API via Fetch API

Styling: Vanilla CSS (Custom Grid Systems)

🚀 Technical Challenges & Engineering Solutions
1. Data Integrity & Async Management

Challenge: Ensuring UI stability when handling asynchronous requests and potential API failures.

Solution: Implemented defensive programming with conditional rendering and centralized error handling. This ensures the user always sees a consistent interface, even during network latencies.

2. State-Driven Search Optimization

Challenge: Maintaining a fluid UI while managing real-time search queries and heavy data payloads.

Solution: Optimized state management to synchronize search inputs with API calls, reducing unnecessary renders and providing instant visual feedback.

3. Fluid Layouts via CSS Grid

Challenge: Displaying dynamic content (posters/data) across diverse screen resolutions without breaking the visual hierarchy.

Solution: Developed a responsive architecture using CSS Grid and Flexbox, prioritizing content discoverability and a mobile-first experience.

🧠 Key Engineering Takeaways
Dynamic Routing: Advanced handling of URL parameters for deep-linking content.

Component Lifecycle: Professional use of useEffect for clean side-effect management.

Clean Code: Focused on modularity and reusability of UI components.
